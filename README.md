# Usage 

there really is no complex usage for this but there are some general use cases. In order to start writing/reading data to and from a process you have to first include the .hpp file then check the process or initate it.

```cpp
	auto MEMZ = Memory_Manager{
		"Process.exe"
	};
```

once you are finished starting the memory manager you can begin loading memory modules such as dll files and loading them to be written to such as the following example 

```cpp
	const auto Kernel = MEMZ.Load_Module_Address("kernel32.dll");
```

then you can use the read and write functions to read and or write memory to the loaded process for example 

```cpp
		const auto Manager = MEMZ.R<std::uintptr_t>(Kernel + 0x35C4);
```
