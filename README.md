# WinMWRP
Win-MWRP stands for Windows Memory Writer Reader Processing. This repo is a file you can use to read processes, write to the processes and or get the base to a module address. This example can be used for really anything from game cheating to even managing your own processes. This file is very small and has its limit's but it is worth the use!
